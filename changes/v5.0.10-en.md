# v5.0.10

## Enhancements

- Improve `/nodes` API responsiveness [#9221](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9221).

- Allow clear retained/delayed data when client is banned [#9139](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9139).

- Update `gen_rpc` library to version 3.0 [#9187](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9187).

- Improve memory usage on core nodes when bootstrapping a replicant [#9236](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9236).

- Improve stability of Prometheus Push Gateway and log errors when POST fails [#9235](http://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9235).

- Now it is possible to opt out VM internal metrics in prometheus stats [#9222](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9222).
  When system load is high, reporting too much metrics data may cause the prometheus stats API timeout.


## Bug fixes

- Fix error log message when `mechanism` is missing in authentication config [#8924](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8924).

- Fixed the HTTP response status code for the `/status` endpoint [#9211](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9211).
  Before the fix, it always returned `200` even if the EMQX application was not running. Now it returns `503` in that case.

- Fix message delivery related event encoding [#9228](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9228).
  This bug was introduced in v5.0.9. For Rule-Engine's input events like `$events/message_delivered`
  and `$events/message_dropped`, if the message was delivered to a shared-subscription,
  the encoding (to JSON) of the event will fail.
